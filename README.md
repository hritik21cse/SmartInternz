The detection of COVID-19 using deep learning techniques applied to chest X-ray and CT scan images enables faster clinical assessment compared to traditional PCR tests. Advanced AI models help identify COVID-19-related abnormalities in medical images, assisting in early diagnosis and treatment. To enhance accuracy and performance, transfer learning techniques such as Inception V3, ResNet50, and Xception V3 are employed. These models have shown high efficiency in medical image classification, providing a reliable and time-saving solution for COVID-19 detection.
